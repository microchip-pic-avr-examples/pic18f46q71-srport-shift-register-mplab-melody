# SIPO Shift Register Using Signal Routing Port

This project highlights the advanced core-independent peripherals found on the PIC18-Q71 family of devices to create a Serial-In Parallel-Out (SIPO) shift register. This project implements the Signal Routing Port (SRPORT) module to shift and store the incoming data based on a clock signal. The Direct Memory Access (DMA) module is used to transfer data between peripherals and the memory core independently without any CPU intervention. The Pulse-Width Modulator (PWM) modules are used to generate clock and data signals. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART) module is used to transmit data on the serial bus.

## Shift Register
Shift registers are important digital components that can be used to store and transfer data. A SIPO shift register can be used in applications where data buffering or data acquisition based on a clock is needed. A SIPO shift register consists of multiple flip flops chained together in series with data and clock signals as inputs. In this code example, the parallel output is stored as bytes of data in memory. A block diagram of a basic SIPO shift register is shown below:

## 1. Setup

The following peripheral configurations are set up using MPLAB速 Code Configurator (MCC) Melody for the PIC18F46Q71:

<br><img src="images/Q71-BUILDER.png" width="700">

- **SRPORT**
<br>In this code example, the Signal Routing Port module is used to shift and store data based on an incoming clock signal. The SRPORT is configured as a shift register by internally connecting the output of each signal routing pin to the input of the previous signal routing pin.
<br><img src="images/Q71-SRPORT-SETUP.png" width="800">

  The value of the signal is stored and shifted at each rising edge of the clock signal. After each eight clock cycles, an eight-bit value representing the data signal (for the previous eight clock cycle time frame) is stored in the PORTW register. The value of the PORTW register should be read or transferred to memory before the next rising edge of the clock. The timing diagram of a SIPO shift register is shown below:

- **TU16A**
<br>In this project, the Universal Timer is used to monitor and count the rising edge of the input clock signal. This Universal Timer module triggers DMA1 to transfer data from PORTW register to RAM every eight clock cycles (one byte of data). The output of the timer is in pulse mode, which can be used to monitor or trigger any other modules/components (as necessary), based on the application.

- **TMR2**
<br>The Timer2 module is used in conjunction with the CLC module to create a hardware based code-free switch debouncer. The push button on the Curiosity HPC board is used to start each round of data shift, storage and transfer (based on the number of bytes configured by the user). Timer2 automates the debouncing process using its monostable mode of operation. In this mode, the first switch activation is used to start the timer counting, ignoring any subsequent bouncing. Once the timer count reaches a predetermined value, the timer peripheral will produce a signaling event that can be used to indicate a valid switch activation has been detected.

## 2. Operation

When the push button (S2) on the Curiosity HPC board is pressed, the Universal Timer will monitor and count each rising edge of the clock signal. After eight clock cycles (at PR match), the DMA1 will start transferring 1 byte of data from the PORTW register to a location in memory (mem_block). The abort trigger of the DMA1 module is set to its destination counter reaching zero, and the destination message size is configurable by the user in code (NUM_BYTE). Changing the NUM_BYTE value in code will define the number of bytes of data that are acquired, shifted, and stored in memory. After data storage, the DMA2 module transfers the stored data to the UART1 transmit buffer. The hardware setup, signal diagrams (Data, CLK, LED and UART signals) and the MPLAB Data Visualizer output are shown below for NUM_BYTE = 1:

## 3. Summary
The Signal Routing Port peripheral offers advanced interconnectivity of multiple core-independent peripherals without requiring any external pins. The SRPORT is also connected to the input and output Peripheral Pin Select module, allowing connections to physical pins when desired, and is also equipped with dedicated Interrupt-on-Change and DMA/ADC triggers. Additionally, this peripheral has the option to be clocked, allowing it to be used to implement a shift register or hardware based state
machines.

Using the DMA module is a great way to transfer data between different peripherals and memory regions. It allows for speed and ease of use, in addition to freeing up the CPU to perform other tasks.

Timer2 HLT can be combined with CLC for an excellent code-free switch debouncing technique.
